# Development instructions

## Prerequisites

### Node.js

Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). See the [`.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc) file for the required version.

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). It is great at managing multiple versions of Node.js on one machine, especially when [configured to automatically use the required version](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration).

### pnpm

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for managing our dependencies.

## Running instructions

```
$ git clone git@github.com:guardian/consent-management-platform.git
$ cd consent-management-platform
$ pnpm
```

## Dev Server

```bash
$ pnpm dev
```

## IDE setup

We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Testing

### CMP App

1. In the base directory, Run pnpm validate to check lint, test and build commands. The command below executes all the required commands to ensure your code passed code quality tests:

```
$ pnpm validate
```

This runs our linting tool, the TypeScript compiler and our tests.

You can also run these tasks individually:

```
$ pnpm lint
$ pnpm tsc
$ pnpm test
```

If you get lint errors, you can attempt to automatically fix them with:

```
$ pnpm fix
```

2. In the base directory, Run pnpm start to serve the test-page.

```
$ pnpm start
```

### Monitoring Directory

1. Change directory to monitoring and run pnpm validate to check lint, test and build commands

```
$ cd monitoring
$ pnpm validate
```

2. Run pnpm start and test against prod

```
$ pnpm start --env=prod --jurisdiction=tcfv2
```

### Symlink

The pnpm link command allows you to load a module from anywhere on your computer.

1. In the command line in your terminal, navigate to the base directory. Run:

```
pnpm link
```

This will create a global link allowing consent-management-platform to be globally accessible by your other projects.

2. Navigate to the repo that will test your app. In the root of this folder, run

```

pnpm link @guardian/consent-management-platform

```

This is where you link the repo to the dependent component. Note: The link name should be the dependency npm package name taken from the name property in package.json.

3. Once youâ€™ve developed your changes and tested, you can unlink.

In your parent project terminal, go ahead and run npm unlink fancy-button to unlink the dependency.

```
pnpm unlink @guardian/consent-management-platform

```

### Extensions

VSCode should prompt you to install our recommended extensions when you open the project.

You can also find these extensions by searching for `@recommended` in the extensions pane.

## Releasing

Changes are automatically released to [NPM][].

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/consent-management-platform

This repository uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management

To release a new version with your changes, run `pnpm changeset add` and follow the prompts. This will create a new changeset file in the `.changeset` directory. Commit this file with your PR.

When your PR is merged, changeset will analyse the changes and create a PR to release the new version.

### Beta

To trigger a beta release, apply the `[beta] @guardian/consent-management-platform` label to your pull request. This action will automatically trigger the [`cmp-beta-release-on-label.yml`](../.github/workflows/cmp-beta-release-on-label.yml) workflow. Upon completion, the beta version will be posted by the `github-actions bot` in your pull request.

To re-trigger a beta-release on the same branch, remove the label and then reapply it.

### CI/CD

This project also uses [github action workflow](../.github/workflows/README.md) to manage it's CI/CD.

### Pull requests

Try to write PR titles in the conventional commit format, and [squash and merge](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) when merging. That way your PR will trigger a release when you merge it (if necessary).
