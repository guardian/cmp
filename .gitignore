# riff-raff.yaml is auto-generated by @guardian/cdk into `cdk/cdk.out/riff-raff.yaml`.
# It's copied to the root of the repository for @guardian/node-riffraff-artifact.
# As it's generated, we don't need to track it in VCS.
# TODO move to https://github.com/guardian/actions-riff-raff in place of @guardian/node-riffraff-artifactt to remove this oddity
